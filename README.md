# Excel-Project

This readme file was created to demonstrate my data analysis learning curve with various applications like Excel, PowerBI, SQL, and Python. I will explain various lessons I learned here and will upload the completed projects during my course.

Week 0 of my course was much of an introduction to applications we will be using in the coming days, while week 1 was focused on various Excel formulas to format the data available.

Here is an image that shows various Excel formulas. I used the practice datasets to use the formula shown in this screenshot.

Apart from the above practice, I had to complete a few case study questions, which had to be completed using the knowledge I gained during my first week session.
Let me share questions and answers/responses to those questions.
