# Excel-Project

This readme file is created to demonstrate my Data analysis learning curve with various applications like Excel, PowerBI, SQL and Python. I will explain various lessions I learned here and will upload the completed projects during my course.

Week 0 of my course was much of an introduction to applications we will be using in coming days, while week 1 was focused on various Excel formulas to format the data available.

Here is a image which shows various excel formulas. I used the practise datasets to use the formula shown in this screenshot.
